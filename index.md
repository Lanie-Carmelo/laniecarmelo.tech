Blind, autistic, chronically ill programmer, usability tester, and accessibility advocate focused on inclusive design.

My work sits at the intersection of **faith, technology, and disability advocacy**.
As a Christian, I approach accessibility as both a technical responsibility and a reflection of God's love for His children.

## What I Focus On

- **Accessibility & usability testing**  
  Evaluating software and digital tools with a focus on real-world accessibility for disabled users.

- **Programming & learning**  
  Building skills and projects with accessibility in mind from the start.

- **Disability advocacy**  
  Sharing lived experience to help make technology more inclusive for people with multiple disabilities.

- **Faith-informed perspective**  
  Approaching life, work, and advocacy through a Christ-centered lens.

- **Documenting accessibility barriers**  
  Writing about recurring accessibility challenges I encounter in games and interactive media, grounded in lived
  experience as a blind, autistic, chronically ill user.

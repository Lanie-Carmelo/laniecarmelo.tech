# Welcome to the Digital Hub of Lanie Carmelo

Welcome to my corner of the web‚Äîa space where faith, technology, and disability advocacy come together.
My deep Christian faith is the cornerstone of my mission to create a more accessible world through technology.

As a blind, autistic, and chronically ill programmer and usability tester, I share my journey in coding, accessibility, and advocacy through a Christ-centered lens. Together, let‚Äôs make the digital realm inclusive for all, reflecting God‚Äôs love for His children.
